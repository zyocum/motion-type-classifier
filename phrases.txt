 09-aug-2003 on saturday 9th august 2003 daniel and i start with our enduros approx 100 kilometers from the confluence point in the preceding years i travelled some thousand offroad kilometers in romania and therefore we take the most beautiful enduro paths to the confluence point naturally there is also something new to discover the last kilometers before we take the forest road which leads approximately toward the confluence point we are driving on the street because it goes steeply uphill from the valley and is is rather hard to drive in the forest i drove through this road section already several times conscious that it is very near to the confluence point n 45° e 22° for the first time in august 1999 however without knowing of the degree confluence project my friend ulrich leardi told me of it we bend off on the forest road which is partly freshly graded in the top there are even completely new branches toward to the confluence point because of the present timber work we try to drive near on the wood-cutting tracks as close as possible and after approx 2 hours of travel we got the motorcycles to within 530 meters of the confluence point we cross a light hardwood forest and a deeply cut brook bed in our maps the confluence point would have to lie on a clearing at the top the forest becomes lighter we goe toward it and discover a clearing grown mainly with large ferns the confluence point is however still approx 100 meters further southwest we dive again into the hardwood forest and cross a further deeply cut brook bed the confluence point is now a few steps from here and we move in a zigzag through the forest the arrow on the gps jumping again and again around after several attempts however we always land in the same place here is the confluence point we take a few pictures unfortunately without the hoped-for view and take a small rest then we take the way back through the wonderful landscape having afterwards a very interesting enduro week with many beautiful offroad kilometers romania has very much nature to offer the hospitality of the people is terrific this country is always worth a journey 02-jan-2010 on the way back from our winter sports holiday the confluence point 48n 10e was situated only a few kilometres away from the autobahn a96 resp a7 such an opportunity should be taken the gps routed us through the village ‘ rot an der rot ’ in a very friendly atmosphere we saw an affectionately restored monastery building furthermore the trip lead us into the village of spindelwag woodwork seems to play an important role here on the one hand i never saw more palettes on a heap before on the other hand a big wooden hull was produced over the street after about 1,000 meters we reached the confluence point on a court from a homestead in these late hours i did n't wanted to disturb anybody so i did my short confluence dance without the approval of the owners apart from the noises of the live stock in the stable i could n't hear anything or see anybody despite the darkness the needed pictures turned out quite well the gps reception was very good and stable in spite of the buildings around
