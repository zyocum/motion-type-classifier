<center><i>"It is often forgotten that (dictionaries) are artificial
<BR>repositories, put together well after the languages they
<BR>define. The roots of language are irrational and of a
<BR>magical nature."</i>
<BR>-Jorge Luis Borges, Prologue to "El otro, el mismo."</center>
<BR>
<BR>
         This project began after I looked for a free dictionary of word origins online and found none. You could subscribe to the Oxford English Dictionary for $550 a year. [In 2004, OED Online lowered the annual subscription for individuals to $295 a year, and introduced monthly subscriptions for $29.95.] There were free dictionaries with definitions, some lists of slang words and their supposed origins, and some sites that listed a few dozen of the strangest etymologies. There were message boards where you could submit a question and wait a few days or weeks for an expert to answer. Or not. But there was no comprehensive public dictionary of the histories of words we use every day -- words like <i>the</i> and <i>day</i>.
<BR>
<BR>
         No university had seen fit to shackle its graduate students to the cyber-mill, grinding out an online etymology dictionary.  I had time on my hands then, and I decided to do it. I also did this to increase my understanding of the language, and its ancestors and relatives. As a writer and editor with an amateur's passion for linguistics, I took this as a joy ride more than drudgery. And now I know so much more useless trivia than I did when I started (<i>applaud</i> is related to <i>explode</i>; three people can have a <i>dialogue</i>; and if anyone calls you <i>feisty</i>, slug him).
<BR>
<BR>
         Etymologies are not definitions; they're explanations of what our words meant 600 or 2,000 years ago. Think of it as looking at pictures of your friends' parents when they were your age. People will continue to use words as they will, finding wider meanings for old words and coining new ones to fit new situations. In fact, this list is a testimony to that process.<BR>
<BR>
         These are histories of words only, not things or ideas. The modern word for something might have replaced old, forgotten words for the same object or concept. (Where possible, I've tried to indicate that.)

This was before the rapid divergence of West Norse (Norway and the colonies) and East Norse (Denmark and Sweden), so the language of the vikings in England was essentially the same, whether they came from Denmark or from Norway. Only a few of the loan words into English can be distinguished as being from one or the other group.

<center><h2>METHODOLOGY</h2></center>
<p>
This is the creation of an amateur. Great care has been taken and it's as accurate as I can make it. But if you're a professional linguist or a serious student of linguistics, you shouldn't be doing your homework here. This is for the rest of us.
<BR>
<BR>
Etymonline is compiled from published sources and in some points from original material made available on the Internet. The first step was to draw up a list of English words out of an ordinary dictionary and seek their etymologies.
<BR>
<BR>
To compile an entry, I look up the word in my major sources: the Oxford English Dictionary (second edition), the Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology (1988),  Weekley’s "Etymological Dictionary of Modern English" (1921), and Ernest Klein's “Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language” (1971). 
<BR>
<BR>
In most cases, all of these offered substantially the same derivations. My work was to merge them and put them into a consistent and accessible format. In some cases, one text offered information where others were silent. I’ve erred on the side of inclusion. In a few cases, they differed significantly in their derivations. I’ve tried to indicate that. In some cases they varied in their descriptions of the precise path a word took through Latin and French to English. I have not always indicated these differences.
<BR>
<BR>
The next step was to take the draft entry to my secondary shelf of sources: principally dictionaries of Old English, Middle English, Latin, Greek, French, and etymology dictionaries for French (Gamillscheg), German (Kluge) and Latin (Tucker). From these I attempted to flesh out the entries and give them some nuance and answer some questions I had about words that the big books did not notice.
<BR>
<BR>
For slang and colloquial usage, I consult the Kipfer/Chapman "Dictionary of American Slang" (which despite its title embraces many Britishisms), DARE, and Farmer. And for navigating the back alleys of English I had as a lantern the always delightful "Dictionary of Buckish Slang, University Wit and Pickpocket Eloquence. "
<BR>
<BR>
The list of books on the secondary shelf has changed somewhat since the work began. At the start, I made use of a couple of books which seemed authoritative but eventually revealed themselves to be whimsical or worse. One was so deadly it became the only book I’ve ever destroyed as a menace to society. I’ve tried to weed out the bad seeds they left in this work. It’s possible a few remain.
<BR>
<BR>
Originally I did not intend to include Proto-Indo-European roots, in part because there was such wide disagreement among the sources I consulted, in part because the whole field seems so speculative. But users wrote to me seeking them, so I’ve added them to the best of my ability, mainly based on the Watkins “American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots” but also by consulting Pokorny.
<BR>
<BR>
With many words, root meanings or sense evolutions remain obscure. I would be content to leave them as such, but readers are curious to know what guesses have been made (or dismissed) by the experts, as well as what facts have been settled. So I’ve included such speculations that have appeared in the sources I consulted. They ought to be prefaced by “perhaps” in this text, even where the sources say “probably.”
<BR>
<BR>
My tendency at first was to “clump” the words -- have, say, <span class="foreign">sleep, sleeper, sleepwalking, sleepy, slept</span> all under one head. But the tyranny of search engines has tended to turn me into a “splitter.”
<BR>
<BR>
In many cases my want of education in this field has led me astray in understanding or interpreting the sources, and in others I’ve simply bungled my notes, or typed things amiss. Many readers, including many academics, have been kind enough to point these out, as they find them, and set me right. Whatever indignation they might feel at my trespass on their demesne, they appreciate the usefulness of a free, ready online resource and have contributed much to make it better than I could.
<BR>
<BR>
<b>A NOTE ON DATES</b>: Old English manuscripts are too few and of too uncertain origin for dates to have any meaning. In Middle English, this site generally makes use of the dates in the Barnhart dictionary, whose compilers gave especial attention to this period, and the online version of the University of Michigan's exhaustive <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/med/"><b>Middle English Dictionary</b></a>. The Oxford English Dictionary is the principal source of dates in modern English up to about 1800. 
<BR>
<BR>
For the 19th and 20th centuries, the OED print edition's inattention to American sources begins to tell: As recently as the 2001 printing of the hardcover 2nd edition, there was no entry for a good American word like "bloviate," "dribble" was recognized as a term in soccer but not in basketball, and the earliest citation for Dixieland music was from "Punch." The OED is a monumental work, rightly revered, but a suspicion arises that there might be more to the language than what is in it. The OED's editors and stringers are constantly revising and updating their text.
<BR>
<BR>
The recent availability of newspaper and magazine archives in computer files, and the flood of material presented in the searchable Google books project, opens a vast field for careful research -- careful because the Google publications too often are misdated on the Google introduction pages. The bulk of the 19th and 20th century dates in this work have been found, or confirmed, in such sources. 
<BR>
<BR>
The availability of Internet newsgroups archives -- again, used judiciously -- is a convenient way to find rough early dates for the most contemporary words. 
<BR>
<BR>
<center><h2>DEDICATIONS</h2></center>
<p>
One of my chief sources for this work is Ernest Klein's dictionary. Klein, Rabbi of Nové Zámky in Czechoslovakia from 1931-44, was deported to Dachau and returned home after liberation to find "that my father, my wife, my only child Joseph, and two of my three sisters had suffered martyrdom in Auschwitz." He moved to Canada, and out of his sorrow and urged on by his surviving sister he set down his lifelong love of etymology into a book, and in its introduction he wrote: 
<blockquote>
May this dictionary, which plastically shows the affinity and interrelationship of the nations of the world in the way in which their languages developed, contribute to bringing them nearer to one another in the sincere pursuit of peace on earth -- which was one of my cardinal aims in writing this dictionary.
